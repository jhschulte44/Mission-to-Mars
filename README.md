# Mission to Mars
## Project Overview
Hello and welcome to the Mission to Mars headquarters! Our mission was to extract Mars data, such as recent news, tables, and images, and display the data in one central location for anybody to easily access. We accomplished this through: 
* Web scraping in python 
* Uploading data into a MongoDB database
* Creating flask routes connecting out database to html
